Active B12 represents 10-30% of the total B12 in the blood, and is the only form of B12 that the cells can actually use- this makes it the best measure of B12 status. Folate (or vitamin B9) works cloesly with Vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. A deficiency in B vitamins can cause tiredness, heart palpitations, pins and needles and shortness of breath. ",

The basic thyroid profile includes Thyroxine (T4), which is the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It also includes Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) which is released by the pituitary gland in the brain to regulate the thyroid gland. An overactive or underactive thyroid leads to hormone imbalances which can cause symptoms such as tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.",
